    <h1>Come to Asgarnia!</h1>
    <p>Goblins, white knights, wizards, trolls, moles, scenic mountains, rivers, and beautiful greenery! Does this sound
        like the perfect travel destination for you? Maybe perhaps perchance you'd prefer the comfort of The Wilderness,
        you disgusting buffoon. Well, with Travel Agency, you can go to either of these two places (but nowhere else,
        sorry)!
    </p>
    <h2>Packages</h2>
    <p>We have many deals for you to choose from. Would you like to spend the night in the gorgeous peaks of White Wolf
        Mountain? We offer that as a package deal with an itinerary of Faladorian Guards to accompany you for the low
        low price of $49,000! Not up your alley? You can join the Lady of the Lake beneath her serene pond and learn to
        wield the mighty Excalibur for a paltry sum of GP50,000,000!</p>
