        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>2 15-oz. cans chickpeas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups red onion, fine chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 cup canned tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp coriander powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp curry powder (or 1 tsp garam masala)</li>
            <li>1/2 to 1 tsp garam masala (more for sweeter taste)</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar (optional, balances the acidity)</li>
            <li>3/4 cups water or stock (up to 1 1/4 cups, see notes)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups coconut milk (do <strong>NOT</strong> substitute cream of coconut unless you want this to
                taste like baked beans!)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add oil to a large pot, dutch oven, or caldero over medium heat. Heat the oil for about 5 minutes (but
                do not let it smoke).</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onions, and mix them well to coat them in the oil. Cook until golden, stirring every 2
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the ground ginger and garlic powder. Saute until the spices are aromatic, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to a simmer. Add salt, Kashmiri red chili powder, turmeric, cumin powder, coriander
                powder, and curry powder/garam masala.</li>
            <li>Give everything a quick stir, making sure not to burn the spices. If the heat of the pan is too high,
                remove it from the burner while doing this step. Let the spices cook until they are aromatic, about 1
                minute.</li>
            <li>Add the canned tomato puree and increase the heat to medium. Cook for about 2 minutes, just enough to
                remove
                some of the "canned taste" from the puree. Taste it to make sure it suits your palate before
                moving on.
            </li>
            <li>Check your chickpeas and make sure they are tender and not hard. Then, add the chickpeas, water/stock,
                and coconut milk.
                <p>
                    Note: If
                    you
                    <em>really</em> don't
                    feel like rinsing them, you can add them along with the liquid from the
                    can (called aquafaba). This is not recommended, but you can. You may just need to adjust the spices
                    to
                    account for the taste. If you do, decrease the water/stock you add by about 1/2 cup.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Cook for 15 minutes on low heat, stirring every 5 minutes so the curry doesn't burn at the bottom. You
                can cook for a little longer, depending on how thick you like your curry. Either way, when done, the
                chickpeas should have a melt-in-your-mouth texture, and all the flavors of the curry should be absorbed.
                If they taste bland, cook for a little longer and add more water/stock if needed.
                <p>Note: If you like your curry thinner, keep the lid on. It will retain the moisture and the flavors.
                    If you keep the lid on and you want it thick, the cooking process will simply take longer.</p>
                <p>Optional: Simmer on the lowest heat setting for 45 minutes to 1 hour, uncovered for the first 15
                    minutes, for maximum flavor and thickness.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the garam masala and sugar (if using). Taste test and add more of either if needed, or add more
                salt if needed.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat completely. Cover until servedâ€”this will help retain the flavors of the garam masala.
                Store in the fridge covered in a bowl or, if feeling extra lazy, just store it in the pot it was cooked
                in (but you'd better make sure it's cooled down all the way before you do, or you'll break your fridge
                shelf's
                glass)!
            </li>
            <li>When the temperature comes down a bit, like drinkable hot cocoa level of hot, garnish with chopped
                cilantro leaves and squeeze some lemon juice. Or if you made this all for yourself like I did, do all
                this with each
                bowl you eat in the coming days.</li>
            <li>Serve over or with steamed rice, pasta, bread, tortillas, biscuits, or whatever grain you want.</li>
